* mfcalc
A C example of a multi-function calculator.  Extracted from the
documentation.

* calc++
A C++ version of the canonical example for parsers: a calculator.  Also uses
Flex for the scanner.  Extracted from the documentation.

* variant.yy
A C++ example that uses variants (they allow to use any C++ type as semantic
value type) and symbol constructors (they ensure consistency between
declared token type and effective semantic value).

* variant-11.yy
Another C++ example, closely related to the previous one, but exhibiting
support for C++11's move semantics.
